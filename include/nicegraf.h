/**
 * \defgroup ngf Core C API
 * This section contains the documentation for the core nicegraf routines,
 * structures and enumerations.
 *
 * \subsection core-remarks General Remarks
 *
 * - The library is currently not intended to be linked dynamically.
 *
 * - When nicegraf's C headers are included from C++, all global functions
 *   within them are automatically declared to have C linkage. Additionally,
 *   they are declared to be noexcept.
 *
 * \subsection object-model Object Model
 *
 * nicegraf objects, such as images, buffers, render targets, etc., are
 * represented using opaque handles. The objects are created and destroyed
 * explicitly by the application, and it is the responsibility of the
 * application to ensure a correct order of destruction.
 *
 * \subsection error-reporting Error Reporting
 *
 * Most nicegraf routines report their completion status by returning an
 * \ref ngf_error, and write their results to out-parameters. The returned value
 * is a generic error code. Detailed, human-readable information about errors
 * may vary from platform to platform; nicegraf reports it by invoking a
 * user-provided callback function (see \ref ngf_diagnostic_info). The callback
 * function must accept the diagnostic message type (see
 * \ref ngf_diagnostic_message_type), an arbitrary void pointer (the value of
 * which the user may specify when providing the callback), a printf-style
 * format string, and an arbitrary number of arguments specifying the data for
 * the format-string.
 *
 * \subsection host-memory-management Host Memory Management
 *
 * By default, nicegraf uses the standard malloc/free to manage host memory for
 * internal purposes. The client may override this behavior by supplying custom
 * memory allocation callbacks (see \ref ngf_allocation_callbacks).
 *
 * \subsection gpu-memory-management GPU Memory Management
 *
 * nicegraf internally manages GPU memory for all backends. It is currently not
 * possible for clients to override this behavior and do their own GPU memory
 * management.
 *

 * performing most of the library's functionality. This includes, but is not

 * resources, such as images, buffers and command buffers; recording and
 * submitting command buffers.
 *
 * Most operations, with the exception of `ngf_init` and context management
 * functions themelves, require a context to be "current" on the calling
 * thread.
 *
 * Invoking `ngf_set_context` will make a context current on the calling
 * thread. Once a context is made current on a thread, it cannot be migrated to
 * another thread.
 *
 * The results of using resources created within one context, in another
 * context are undefined, unless the two contexts are explicitly configured to
 * share data. When contexts are configured as shared, resources created in one
 * can be used in the other, and vice versa. Notably, command buffers created
 * and recorded in one context, can be submitted in another, shared context.
 *
 * A context mainatins exclusive ownership of its swapchain (if it has one),
 * and even shared contexts cannot acquire, present or render to images from
 * that swapchain.

/**
 * @struct ngf_cmd_buffer
 * \ingroup ngf
 * Encodes a series of rendering commands.
 *
 * Internally, a command buffer may be in any of the following five states:
 *   - new;
 *   - ready;
 *   - recording;
 *   - awaiting submission;
 *   - submitted.
 *
 * Every newly created command buffer is in the "new" state. It can be
 * transitioned to the "ready" state by calling `ngf_start_cmd_buffer` on it.
 *
 * When a command buffer is in the "ready" state, you may begin recording a new
 * series of rendering commands into it.
 *
 * Recording commands into a command buffer is performed using command
 * encoders. There are a few different types of encoders, supporting different
 * types of commands.
 *
 * A new encoder may be created for a command buffer only if the command buffer
 * is in either the "ready" or the "awaiting submission" state.
 *
 * Creating a new encoder for a command buffer transitions that command buffer
 * to the "recording" state.
 *
 * Finishing and disposing of an active encoder transitions its corresponding
 * command buffer into the "awaiting submission" state.
 *
 * The three rules above mean that a command buffer may not have more than
 * one encoder active at a given time.
 *
 * Once all of the desired commands have been recorded, and the command buffer
 * is in the "awaiting submission" state, the command buffer may be submitted
 * for execution via a call to \ref ngf_cmd_buffer_submit, which transitions it
 * into the "submitted" state.
 *
 * Submission may only be performed on command buffers that are in the
 * "awaiting submission" state.
 *
 * Once a command buffer is in the "submitted" state, it is
 * impossible to append any new commands to it.
 * It is, however, possible to begin recording a new, completely separate batch
 * of commands by calling \ref ngf_cmd_buffer_start which implicitly
 * transitions the buffer to the "ready" state if it is already "submitted".
 * This does not affect any previously submitted commands.
 *
 * Calling a command buffer function on a buffer that is in a state not
 * expected by that function will result in an error. For example, calling
 * \ref ngf_cmd_buffer_submit would produce an error on a buffer that is in
 * the "ready" state, since, according to the rules outlined above,
 * \ref ngf_cmd_buffer_submit expects command buffers to be in the "awaiting
 * submission" state.
 *
 * Command buffers may be recorded in parrallel on different threads. Recording
 * and destroying a command buffer must always be done by the same thread that
 * created it.
 *
 * Submitting a command buffer for execution may be done by a different thread,
 * as long as the submitting and recording threads have shared contexts.
 *
 * Access to command buffer objects from different threads must be synchronized
 * by the application. In other words, it falls on the application to ensure
 * that no two threads ever access the same command buffer simultaneously.

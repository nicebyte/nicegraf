/**
 * \defgroup ngf Core C API
 * This section contains documentation for the core nicegraf routines,
 * structures and enumerations.
 *
 * \subsection core-remarks General Remarks
 *
 * - The library is currently not intended to be linked dynamically.
 *
 * - When nicegraf's C headers are included from C++, all global functions
 *   within them are automatically declared to have C linkage. Additionally,
 *   they are declared to be noexcept.
 *
 * \subsection object-model Objects 
 *
 * nicegraf objects, such as images, buffers, render targets, etc., are
 * represented using opaque handles. The objects are constructed and destroyed
 * explicitly by the application, and it is the responsibility of the
 * application to ensure that the order of destruction is correct.
 * For applications written in C++, a set of wrappers that automate object
 * lifetime management is available. See \ref ngf_wrappers for details.
 *
 * \subsection error-reporting Error Reporting
 *
 * Most nicegraf routines report their completion status by returning an
 * \ref ngf_error, and write their results to out-parameters. The returned value
 * is a generic error code. Detailed, human-readable information about errors
 * may vary from platform to platform; nicegraf reports it by invoking a
 * user-provided callback function (see \ref ngf_diagnostic_info). The callback
 * function must accept the diagnostic message type (see
 * \ref ngf_diagnostic_message_type), an arbitrary void pointer (the value of
 * which the user may specify when providing the callback), a printf-style
 * format string, and an arbitrary number of arguments specifying the data for
 * the format-string.
 *
 * \subsection host-memory-management Host Memory Management
 *
 * By default, nicegraf uses the standard malloc/free to manage host memory for
 * internal purposes. The client may override this behavior by supplying custom
 * memory allocation callbacks (see \ref ngf_allocation_callbacks).
 *
 * \subsection gpu-memory-management GPU Memory Management
 *
 * nicegraf internally manages GPU memory for all backends. It is currently not
 * possible for clients to override this behavior and do their own GPU memory
 * management.
 *

   * When compiling HLSL shaders using nicegraf-shaderc, the comment with the binding map is

   *
   * As an example, assume the buffer contains data for a single attribute, such as the position of

   *
   * ```
   * In this case, the stride is 3*4 = 12 bytes - the distance from the beginning of the first
   * attribute to the beginning of the next attribute is equal to the size of one attribute value.
   * However, it can be set to 0, because in this case the attribute values are tightly packed - the
   * next immediately follows the previous.
   *
   * Now consider a different case, where we have two attributes: a three-dimensional position and
   * an RGB color, and the buffer first lists all the attribute values for the first vertex,
   * then all attribute values for the second vertex and so on:
   *

 * Images are multidimensional arrays of data that can be sampled from in shaders, or rendered into.
 * The individual elements of such arrays shall be referred to as "texels". An \ref ngf_image_format
 * describes the specific type and layout of data elements within a single texel. Note that
 * compressed image formats typically don't store values of texels directly, rather they store
 * enough information that the texel values can be reconstructed (perhaps lossily) by the rendering
 * device.
 *
 * Images can be one of the following types (see \ref ngf_image_type):
 *  - a two-dimensional image, identified by \ref NGF_IMAGE_TYPE_IMAGE_2D and representing a
 *    two-dimensional array of texels;
 *  - a three-dimensional image, identified by \ref NGF_IMAGE_TYPE_IMAGE_3D and representing a
 *    three-dimensional array of texels;
 *  - a cubemap, identified by \ref NGF_IMAGE_TYPE_CUBE and representing a collection of six
 *    two-dimensional texel arrays, each corresponding to a face of a cube.
 *
 * An image object may actually contain several images of the same type, format and dimensions.
 * Those are referred to as "layers" and images containing more than a single layer are called
 * "layered", or "image arrays". Note that a multi-layered 2D image is different from a
 * single-layered 3D image, because filtering is not performed across levels when sampling it. Also
 * note that layered cubemaps are not supported by all hardware - see \ref
 * ngf_device_capabilities::cubemap_arrays_supported.
 *
 * Each image layer may contain mip levels. Mip level 0 is the layer itself, and each subsequent
 * level (1, 2 and so on) is 2x smaller in dimensions, and usually contains the downscaled version
 * of the preceding level for the purposes of filtering, although the application is free to upload
 * arbitrary data into any mip level, as long as dimension requirements are respected.

 * resources, such as images, buffers and command buffers; recording and

 * thread. Once a context is made current on a thread, it cannot be migrated to
 * another thread.
 *
 * The results of using resources created within one context, in another
 * context are undefined, unless the two contexts are explicitly configured to
 * share data. When contexts are configured as shared, resources created in one
 * can be used in the other, and vice versa. Notably, command buffers created
 * and recorded in one context, can be submitted in another, shared context.
 *
 * A context mainatins exclusive ownership of its swapchain (if it has one),

/**
 * @struct ngf_cmd_buffer
 * \ingroup ngf
 * Encodes a series of rendering commands.
 *
 * Internally, a command buffer may be in any of the following five states:
 *   - new;
 *   - ready;
 *   - recording;
 *   - awaiting submission;
 *   - submitted.
 *
 * Every newly created command buffer is in the "new" state. It can be
 * transitioned to the "ready" state by calling \ref ngf_start_cmd_buffer on it.
 *
 * When a command buffer is in the "ready" state, you may begin recording a new
 * series of rendering commands into it.
 *
 * Recording commands into a command buffer is performed using command
 * encoders. There are a few different types of encoders, supporting different
 * types of commands.
 *
 * A new encoder may be created for a command buffer only if the command buffer
 * is in either the "ready" or the "awaiting submission" state.
 *
 * Creating a new encoder for a command buffer transitions that command buffer
 * to the "recording" state.
 *
 * Finishing and disposing of an active encoder transitions its corresponding
 * command buffer into the "awaiting submission" state.
 *
 * The three rules above mean that a command buffer may not have more than
 * one encoder active at a given time.
 *
 * Once all of the desired commands have been recorded, and the command buffer
 * is in the "awaiting submission" state, the command buffer may be submitted
 * for execution via a call to \ref ngf_submit_cmd_buffers, which transitions it
 * into the "submitted" state.
 *
 * Submission may only be performed on command buffers that are in the
 * "awaiting submission" state.
 *
 * Once a command buffer is in the "submitted" state, it is
 * impossible to append any new commands to it.
 * It is, however, possible to begin recording a new, completely separate batch
 * of commands by calling \ref ngf_start_cmd_buffer which implicitly
 * transitions the buffer to the "ready" state if it is already "submitted".
 * This does not affect any previously submitted commands.
 *
 * Calling a command buffer function on a buffer that is in a state not
 * expected by that function will result in an error. For example, calling
 * \ref ngf_submit_cmd_buffers would produce an error on a buffer that is in
 * the "ready" state, since, according to the rules outlined above,
 * \ref ngf_submit_cmd_buffers expects command buffers to be in the "awaiting
 * submission" state.
